### How to report a bug
To report a bug, you should open an issue. Make sure to tag it as "bug". While you could message someone with write
access to this repository, it's great to catalog bugs and keep track of which ones were reported and fixed.

### How to submit changes
To submit changes, just submit a pull request and explain what the pull request does and why it should be merged. Make
sure that it's in English (American English is preferred). Response times should be a few days at max.

### How to request an enhancement
To request an enhancement, just open an issue and tag it as "enhancement". Make sure that you clearly explain what you
want added and that it's possible to implement it.
